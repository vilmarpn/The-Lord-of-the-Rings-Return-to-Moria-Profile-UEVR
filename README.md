UEVR Profile for The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria â€“ First-Person Mode & Improvements

I created a profile for the UEVR Mod in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria that adds support for first-person mode, improves the aiming system, and adjusts how the weapon is held in VR. Additionally, I implemented a system to hide the character's body, ensuring a more immersive experience.

This profile is still in development and may receive updates, but it already provides a much smoother VR gameplay experience.

I plan to keep creating more profiles for different games, bringing improvements to virtual reality gameplay.
